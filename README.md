# Movie-review-analysis
In this movie review sentiment analysis project i have used deep learning keras models for the classification part. For this I have used a movies dataset which has reviews as well as labels. In this project I first cleaned the text by removing the stop words and then replacing the abbrevations with fullforms. Then I have built a model which contains 2 layers first one was a convolutional neural network followed by a long short term memory. I have used a CNN as this data has a one-dimensional spatial structure in the sequence of words in reviews and the CNN may be able to pick out invariant features for good and bad sentiment then this learned spatial features may then be learned as sequences by an LSTM layer. Later after trainig this model I used precision and recall as well as ROC to determine the suitable threshold for this model. At the end I have even tried a few comments on my own it did pretty well but fails for sarcastic comments
